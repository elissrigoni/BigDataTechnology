#### We call it Techno Pred!
The aim of this project is to design and implement a big data system for estimating annual expenditure on technology of single individuals based on their socio-demographic data. Socio-demographics relate to a combination of social and demographic aspects that define people in a specific group or population. The core idea is that different socio-demographic factors affect the reasons why a customer chooses to invest in technological products and services, and the amount of money invested.
